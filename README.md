## Code Overview

### Key Functions

- **`add_book()`**: Adds a new book to the library.
- **`remove_book()`**: Removes a book from the library by its title.
- **`search_book()`**: Searches for books by title or author.
- **`display_books()`**: Displays all books in the library.
- **`display_stats()`**: Displays library statistics (total books, books read, percentage read).
- **`load_library()`**: Loads the library data from `library.txt`.

### Example Data in `library.txt`

```json
[
    {
        "title": "The Great Gatsby",
        "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
        "year": "1925",
        "genre": "Fiction",
        "read": true
    },

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries are required.

---

## How It Works

1. **Loading Data**:
   - When the program starts, it loads the library data from `library.txt` (if the file exists).
   - If the file doesn't exist, it starts with an empty library.

2. **Saving Data**:
   - Whenever a book is added or removed, the program saves the updated library to `library.txt`.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - The program uses a simple menu system to interact with the user.
   - After each action, the program waits for 5 seconds to give the user time to read the output.
